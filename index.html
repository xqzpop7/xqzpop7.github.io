<!-- 
    Hello user! 
    
    I do not know what business you have here, but I would like if you left this and all my other files alone.
    As all code has different authors, style, varied use cases and so on you will most likely learn less 
    by copying or looking at my work then by contacting me and asking why I did this part the way I did.

    This is not a "You can't copy my work! Nuh Uh, MINEEE!!!!" it's simply a warning from me, a developer.
    Copy all you want, share, laugh at my work even, all I ask for is simply credit where possible, thanks!

    Have a nice and relaxing day! From FruityPop. 30.6.2025
